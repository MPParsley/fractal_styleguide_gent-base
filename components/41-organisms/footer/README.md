# Footer

## Grid implementation
The Stad Gent footer can be used in 3 possible ways, as a:
* 2 column layout
* 3 column layout
* 4 column layout

All versions are fully responsive and should be triggered based on the data-columns attribute on the wrapping div.

For example:
```
<footer class="section--wrapper" role="contentinfo" data-columns="4">
```
Will result in a footer with 4 columns on desktop, 2 columns on tablet and 1 column on mobile.


## Components
Components in the footer should be as defined by the styleguide.
