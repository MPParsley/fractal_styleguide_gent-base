# Headings

Headers create structure. They provide a quick way to scan the main sections of a website.

* Make sure the headline works out of context.
* Use sentence case for headings.
* Headings have no closing punctuation, with the exception of a question mark for questions.
* At least one paragraph of content should follow each heading. Headings of the same weight should never directly follow one another.
* Don’t use links in page headings.
* Use only one H1 per page.
* Don’t skip headings: do not jump from H1 to H3, move from H1 to H2 and then to H3 instead.
* Currently, only Headings 1 to 3 are used.
