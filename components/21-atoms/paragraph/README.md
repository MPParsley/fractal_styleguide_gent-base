# Paragraphs
A paragraph has a certain behavior.
* It should always have a width based on it' container of 7/12.
**This means the container needs to make sure paragraphs can never be bigger then 7/12 of itself.**
* It always has a max-width in REMs of 40rem on desktop.
* For a mobile layout a paragraph is always full width.
* A paragraph can **never** be centered!
* A paragraph can **never** be justified!
