# Map block

The example styling is based on a default implementation of an Open Layers based map. As a result our selectors and SASS are not as clearly as envisioned.

Use the styling in this styleguide as an example or use it in conjunction with the Drupal_base_theme and the dg_maps module to achieve optimal results.

The styling will be refactored, in sync with subsequent releases of the DG Maps module
