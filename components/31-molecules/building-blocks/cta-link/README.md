# CTA links
A CTA link has a certain behavior.

* It should always have a width based on it' container of 7/12. This means the container needs to make sure CTA links can never be bigger then 7/12 of itself.
* It always has a max-width in REMs of 40rem on desktop.
* For a mobile layout a CTA link is always full width.

Examples of paragraphs are defined in paragraph variants:

* <a href="{{path './cta-link'}}">CTA link default</a>
