title: Third party support 
---

## AngularJS CLI support (no SASS globbing)
We provide a `main_cli.scss` file that is essentially the same as `main.scss`, but includes all SASS partials 
the style guide needs without SASS globbing.

#### IMPORTANT:
We recommend using the `main_cli.scss` file only when you need to support Angular CLI.
